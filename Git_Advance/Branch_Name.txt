Way to set a Branch Name

1)wip: works in progress; stuff i know won't be finished soon
2)feat: features i'm adding or expanding
3)bug: bugs fix or experiment
4)junk: throwaway branch created to experiment

-->Suppose i am adding a chating feature in my web page,
      git branch "feat/add-chat-support" 

      git checkout -b "bug/fixing_bug"   //creates bug/fixing_bug branch and moves to that branch
