-->Suppose, I am working on a project. During that project i have made 6 commits on the Main Branch.
   Now Suppose i assign a task to friend Ram to do certain work. He performs 4 commits on the same Branch.
   After his commits, i again made 2 new commits.

   **What is the problem here???
   -->If the commits made by Ram is wrong or the code has errors,
      then it becomes difficult to revert his code. It may effect my code.
   -->The tracking of commits becomes difficult.

-->So while working on a collaborative project, we generally make a new Branch and workon that branch.
   After the completion of the task, we merge the branch with the Main Branch.
   During merging, total commits made in the branch are represented by a single big commit.

#For Making Branch: git branch "Branch_Name"         //Branch is made in local repo//
#For Switching Branch: git checkout "Branch_Name"    //Switching to the branch//
#For Merging Branch: git merge origin/"Branch_Name"         //Merging the branch with the Main Branch//
#For Deleting Branch: git branch -d "Branch_Name"         //Deleting the branch//
